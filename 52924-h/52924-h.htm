<div class="scene">SCENE I.&mdash;[<i>Night.</i>]&mdash;<i>Torc Cregan, the Residence of Mrs. Cregan, on
the Banks of Killarney. House</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span> 2 <span class="smcap lowercase">E.</span>; <i>window facing Audience&mdash;light

<div class="dircenter"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hardress Cregan</span>, <i>from house</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></div>

<p><i>Hard</i> [<i>Going up</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">C.</span>] Hist! Danny, are you there?</p>

<div class="dircenter"><span class="smcap">Danny</span> <i>appearing from below, at back</i>.</div>

<p><i>Danny</i> Is it yourself, Masther Hardress?</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Is the boat ready?</p>

<p><i>Danny</i> Snug under the blue rock, sir.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Does Eily expect me to-night?</p>

<p><i>Danny</i> Expict is it? Here is a lether she bade me give yes; sure
the young thing is never aisy when you are away. Look, masther,
dear, do ye see that light, no bigger than a star beyant on Muckross
Head?</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Yes, it is the signal which my dear Eily leaves burning in
our chamber.</p>

<p><i>Danny</i> All night long she sits beside that light, wid her face fixed
on that lamp in your windy above.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Dear, dear Eily! after all here’s asleep, I will leap from my
window, and we’ll cross the lake.</p>

<p><i>Danny</i> [<i>Searching.</i>] Where did I put that lether?</p>

<div class="dircenter"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Kyrle Daly</span> <i>from house</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></div>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span>] Hardress, who is that with you?</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">C.</span>] Only Mann, my boatman.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> That fellow is like your shadow.</p>

<p><i>Danny</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span>] Is it a cripple like me, that would be the shadow of
an illegant gintleman like Mr. Hardress Cregan?</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span>] Well, I mean that he never leaves your side.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">C.</span>] And he never <i>shall</i> leave me. Ten years ago he was a
fine boy&mdash;we were foster-brothers, and playmates&mdash;in a moment of
passion, while we were struggling, I flung him from the gap rock into
the reeks below, and thus he was maimed for life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Danny</i> Arrah! whist aroon! wouldn’t I die for yez? didn’t the
same mother foster us? Why, wouldn’t ye break my back if it plazed
ye, and welkim! Oh, Masther Kyrle, if ye’d seen him nursin’ me
for months, and cryin’ over me, and keenin’! Sin’ that time, sir, my
body’s been crimpin’ up smaller and smaller every year, but my
heart is gettin’ bigger for him every day.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Go along, Danny.</p>

<p><i>Danny</i> Long life t’ye, sir! I’m off.</p>

<div class="dirownr">[<i>Runs up and descends rocks</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">C.</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span></div>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Hardress, a word with you. Be honest with me&mdash;do you
love Anne Chute?</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Why do you ask?</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Because we have been fellow-collegians and friends through
life, and the five years that I have passed at sea have strengthened,
but have not cooled, my feelings towards you.    <span class="dirr">[<i>Offers hand.</i></span></p>

<div class="dircenter"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Cregan</span>, <i>from house</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></div>

<p><i>Hard</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span>] Nor mine for you, Kyrle. You are the same noble fellow
as ever. You ask me if I love my cousin Anne?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">C.</span>, <i>between them</i>.] And I will answer you, Mr. Daly.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span>] My mother!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">C.</span>] My son and Miss Chute are engaged. Excuse me,
Kyrle, for intruding on your secret, but I have observed your love
for Anne with some regret. I hope your heart is not so far gone as
to be beyond recovery.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span>] Forgive me, Mrs. Cregan, but are you certain that Miss
Chute really is in love with Hardress?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Look at him! I’m sure no girl could do that and doubt it.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> But I’m not a girl, ma’am; and sure, if you are <span class="lock">mistaken&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Hard</i> My belief is that Anne does not care a token for me, and
likes Kyrle better.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">C.</span>] You are an old friend of my son, and I may confide to
you a family secret. The extravagance of my husband left this estate
deeply involved. By this marriage with Anne Chute we redeem
every acre of our barony. My son and she have been brought up
as children together, and don’t know their true feelings yet.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Stop, mother, I know this: I would not wed my cousin if
she did not love me, not if she carried the whole county Kerry in her
pocket, and the barony of Kenmare in the crown of her hat.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Do you hear the proud blood of the Cregans?</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Woo her, Kyrle, if you like, and win her if you can. I’ll
back you.</p>

<div class="dircenter"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Anne Chute</span>, <i>from house</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></div>

<p><i>Anne</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">L. C.</span>] So will I&mdash;What’s the bet?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Hush!</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> I’d like to have bet on Kyrle.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Well, Anne, I’ll tell you what it was.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">C.</span>] Hardress!</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">L. C.</span>] Pull in one side aunt, and let the boy go on.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span>] Kyrle wanted to know if the dark brown colt, Hardress
Cregan, was going to walk over the course for the Anne Chute Stakes,
or whether it was a scrub-race open to all.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> I’m free-trade&mdash;coppleens, mules and biddys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> How can you trifle with a heart like Kyrle’s?</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Trifle! his heart can be no trifle, if he’s all in proportion.</p>

<div class="dircenter"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>, <i>from house</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></div>

<p><i>Servant</i> Squire Corrigan, ma’am, begs to see you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs C</i> At this hour, what can the fellow want? Show Mr. Corrigan
here. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>into house</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span>] I hate this man; he was my husband’s
agent, or what the people here call a middle-man&mdash;vulgarly
polite, and impudently obsequious.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span>] Genus squireen&mdash;a half sir, and a whole scoundrel.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> I know&mdash;a potatoe on a silver plate: I’ll leave you to peel
him. Come, Mr. Daly, take me for a moonlight walk, and be funny.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Funny, ma’am, I’m afraid I <span class="lock">am&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Anne</i> You are heavy, you mean; you roll through the world like
a hogshead of whisky; but you only want tapping for pure spirits
to flow out spontaneously. Give me your arm. [<i>Crossing</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span>] Hold
that glove now. You are from Ballinasloe, I think?</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> I’m Connaught to the core of my heart.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> To the roots of your hair, you mean. I bought a horse at
Ballinasloe fair that deceived me; I hope you won’t turn out to belong
to the same family.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">R. C.</span>] What did he do?</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Oh! like you, he looked well enough&mdash;deep in the chest as a
pool&mdash;a-dhiol, and broad in the back as the Gap of Dunloe&mdash;but after
two days’ warm work he came all to pieces, and Larry, my groom,
said he’d been stuck together with glue.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span>] Really, Miss Chute!    <span class="dirr">[<i>Music.</i>&mdash;<i>Exeunt</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> 1 <span class="smcap lowercase">E.</span></span></p>

<p><i>Hard</i> [<i>Advancing, laughing.</i>] That girl is as wild as a coppleen,&mdash;she
won’t leave him a hair on the head.    <span class="dirr">[<i>Goes up.</i></span></p>

<div class="dircenter"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>, <i>showing in</i> <span class="smcap">Corrigan</span>, <i>from house</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></div>

<div class="dirownr">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></div>

<p><i>Corrigan</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span>] Your humble servant, Mrs. Cregan&mdash;my service t’ye,
’Squire&mdash;it’s a fine night, entirely.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">C.</span>] May I ask to what business, sir, we have the honor
of your call?</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> [<i>Aside</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L. C.</span>] Proud as a Lady Beelzebub, and as grand as a
queen. [<i>Aloud.</i>] True for you, ma’am; I would not have, come, but
for a divil of a pinch I’m in entirely. I’ve got to pay £8,000 to-morrow
or lose the Knockmakilty farms.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Well, sir?</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> And I wouldn’t throuble <span class="lock">ye&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Trouble me, sir?</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> Iss, ma’am&mdash;ye’d be forgettin’ now that mortgage I have
on this property. It ran out last May, and by <span class="lock">rights&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> It will be paid next month.</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> Are you reckonin’ on the marriage of Mister Hardress and
Miss Anne Chute?</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> [<i>Advancing</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span>] Mr. Corrigan, you forget yourself.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Leave us, Hardress, a while. [<span class="smcap">Hardress</span> <i>retires</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span>] Now,
Mr. Corrigan, state, in as few words as possible, what you demand.</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> Mrs. Cregan, ma’am, you depend on Miss Anne Chute’s
fortune to pay me the money, but your son does not love the lady,
or, if he does, he has a mighty quare way of showing it. He has an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>other
girl on hand, and betune the two he’ll come to the ground, and
so bedad will I.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> That is false&mdash;it is a calumny, sir!</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> I wish it was, ma’am. D’ye see that light over the lake?
your son’s eyes are fixed on it. What would Anne Chute say if she
knew that her husband, that is to be, had a mistress beyant&mdash;that
he slips out every night after you’re all in bed, and like Leandher,
barrin’ the wettin’, he sails across to his sweetheart?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Is this the secret of his aversion to the marriage? Fool!
fool! what madness, and at such a moment.</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> That’s what I say, and no lie in it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> He shall give up this girl&mdash;he must!</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> I would like to have some security for that. I want, by to-morrow,
Anne Chute’s written promise to marry him, or my £8,000.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> It is impossible, sir; you hold ruin over our heads.</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> Madam, it’s got to hang over your head or mine.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Stay; you know that what you ask is out of our power&mdash;you
know it&mdash;therefore this demand only covers the true object of
your visit.</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> ’Pon my honor! and you are as ’cute, ma’am, as you are
beautiful!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Go on, sir.</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> Mrs. Cregan, I’m goin’ to do a foolish thing&mdash;now, by
gorra I am! I’m richer than ye think, maybe, and if you’ll give me
your <i>personal</i> security, I’ll take it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> I meant that I’ll take a lien for life on <i>you</i>, instead of the
mortgage I hold on the Cregan property. [<i>Aside.</i>] That’s nate, I’m
thinkin’.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Are you mad?</p>

<p><i>Corrig</i> I am&mdash;mad in love with yourself, and that’s what I’ve been
these fifteen years.    <span class="dirr">[<i>Music through dialogue, till</i> <span class="smcap">Anne Chute</span> <i>is off</i>.</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Hardress.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> What did he want?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> He came to tell me the meaning of yonder light upon Muckross
Head.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Ah! has it been discovered? Well, mother, now you know
the cause of my coldness, my indifference for Anne.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Are you in your senses, Hardress? Who is this girl?</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> She is known at every fair and pattern in Munster as the
Colleen Bawn&mdash;her name is Eily O’Connor.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> A peasant girl&mdash;a vulgar, barefooted beggar!</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Whatever she is, love has made her my equal, and when you
set your foot upon her you tread upon my heart.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> ’Tis well, Hardress. I feel that perhaps I have no right to
dispose of your life and your happiness&mdash;no, my dear son&mdash;I would
not wound you&mdash;heaven knows how well I love my darling boy, and
you shall feel it. Corrigan has made me an offer by which you may
regain the estate, and without selling yourself to Anne Chute.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> What is it? Of course you accepted it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> No, but I will accept, yes, for your sake&mdash;I&mdash;I will. He
offers to cancel this mortgage if&mdash;if&mdash;I will consent to&mdash;become his
wife.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> You&mdash;you, mother? Has he <span class="lock">dared&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Hush! he is right. A sacrifice must be made&mdash;either you
or I must suffer. Life is before you&mdash;my days are well nigh past&mdash;and
for your sake, Hardress&mdash;for yours; my pride, my only one.&mdash;Oh!
I would give you more than my life.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Never&mdash;never! I will not&mdash;can not accept it. I’ll tear that
dog’s tongue from his throat that dared insult you with the offer.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Foolish boy, before to-morrow night we shall be beggars&mdash;outcasts
from this estate. Humiliation and poverty stand like specters
at yonder door&mdash;to-morrow they will be realities. Can you tear
out the tongues that will wag over our fallen fortunes? You are a
child, you can not see beyond your happiness.</p>

Anne is impossible.</p>

wanted a wife, where would he find an angel that ’ud compare
with the Colleen Bawn. As I row her on the lake, the little fishes
come up to look at her; and the wind from heaven lifts up her hair
to see what the divil brings her down here at all&mdash;at all.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> The fault is mine&mdash;mine alone&mdash;I alone will suffer!</p>

<p><i>Danny</i> Why isn’t it mine? Why can’t I suffer for yez, masther
dear? Wouldn’t I swally every tear in your body, every bit of
bad luck in your life, and then wid a stone round my neck, sink myself
and your sorrows in the bottom of the lower lake.</p>

No! but if it goes out entirely, his honor jumps from the parlor

<p><i>Eily</i> No, no; I’ll make it, and nobody else.</p>

<p><i>Father T</i> Aisy now, ye becauns, and whist; Myles shall put in the
whisky, Sheelah shall put in the hot water, and Eily, my Colleen,
shall put the sugar in the cruiskeen. A blessin’ on ye all three that
loves the ould man. [<span class="smcap">Myles</span> <i>takes off hat</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Women</span> <i>curtsey&mdash;they make

the man. [<span class="smcap">Myles</span> <i>pours spirit from keg</i>.] That’s the whisky. There’s
the sugar, which is the smile of woman; [<span class="smcap">Eily</span> <i>puts sugar</i>.] without

harm; but not too much. And the hot water [<span class="smcap">Sheelah</span> <i>pours water</i>.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
which is adversity&mdash;as little as possible if ye plaze&mdash;that makes the

guinea for your riverince that’s come t’ye&mdash;one in ten I got a while

<p><i>Father T</i> Eily, look at that boy, and tell me, haven’t ye a dale to
answer for?</p>

<p><i>Eily</i> He isn’t as bad about me as he used to be; he’s getting over
it.</p>

<p><i>Myles</i> Yes, darlin’, the storm has passed over, and I’ve got into
settled bad weather.</p>

<p><i>Father T</i> Maybe, afther all, ye’d have done better to have married
Myles there, than be the wife of a man that’s ashamed to own ye.</p>

<p><i>Eily</i> He isn’t&mdash;he’s proud of me. It’s only when I spake like the
poor people, and say or do anything wrong, that he’s hurt; but I’m
gettin’ clane of the brogue, and learnin’ to do nothing&mdash;I’m to be
changed entirely.</p>

<p><i>Myles</i> Oh! if he’d lave me yer own self, and only take away wid
him his improvements. Oh! murder&mdash;Eily, aroon, why wasn’t ye
twins, an’ I could have one of ye, only nature couldn’t make two like
ye&mdash;it would be onreasonable to ax it.</p>

<p><i>Eily</i> Poor Myles, do you love me still so much?</p>

<p><i>Myles</i> Didn’t I lave the world to folley ye, and since then there’s
been neither night nor day in my life&mdash;I lay down on Glenna Point
above, where I see this cottage, and I lived on the sight of it. Oh!
Eily, if tears were pison to the grass there wouldn’t be a green blade
on Glenna Hill this day.</p>

<p><i>Eily</i> But you knew I was married, Myles.</p>

<p><i>Myles</i> Not thin, aroon&mdash;Father Tom found me that way, and sat
beside, and lifted up my soul. Then I confessed to him, and, sez he,
“Myles, go to Eily, she has something to say to you&mdash;say I sent you.”
I came, and ye tould me ye were Hardress Cregan’s wife, and that
was a great comfort entirely. Since I knew that [<i>Drinks&mdash;voice in cup.</i>]
I haven’t been the blackguard I was.</p>

<p><i>Father T</i> See the beauty of the priest, my darlin’&mdash;<i>videte et admirate</i>&mdash;see
and admire it. It was at confession that Eily tould me she
loved Cregan, and what did I do?&mdash;sez I, “Where did you meet
your sweetheart?” “At Garryowen,” sez she. “Well,” says I;
“that’s not the place.” “Thrue, your riverince, it’s too public entirely,”
sez she. “Ye’ll mate him only in one place,” sez I; “and
that’s the stile that’s behind my chapel,” for, d’ye see, her mother’s
grave was forenint the spot, and there’s a sperrit round the place,
[<span class="smcap">Myles</span> <i>drinks</i>,] that kept her pure and strong. Myles, ye thafe, drink
fair.</p>

<p><i>Sheelah</i> Come now, Eily, couldn’t ye cheer up his riverince wid the
tail of a song?</p>

<p><i>Eily</i> Hardress bid me not sing any ould Irish songs, he says the
words are vulgar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sheelah</i> Father Tom will give ye absolution.</p>

<p><i>Father T</i> Put your lips to that jug; there’s only the strippens left.
Drink! and while that thrue Irish liquor warms your heart, take this
wid it. May the brogue of ould Ireland niver forsake your tongue&mdash;may
her music niver lave yer voice&mdash;and may a true Irishwoman’s
virtue niver die in your heart!</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> What do I mane! Mean&mdash;mean!</p>

<p><i>Eily</i> I beg your pardon, dear.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> Well; I mean that after to-morrow there will be no necessity
to hide our marriage, for I shall be a beggar, my mother will be an
outcast, and amidst all the shame, who will care what wife a Cregan
takes?</p>

<p><i>Eily</i> And d’ye think I’d like to see you dhragged down to my side&mdash;ye

on to mortal that we’re married&mdash;I’ll go as a servant in your mother’s

be happy, if ye’ll only let me stand outside and hear your voice.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> You’re a fool. I told you that I was bethrothed to the richest
heiress in Kerry; her fortune alone can save us from ruin. To-night
my mother discovered my visits here, and I told her who you
were.</p>

<p><i>Eily</i> Oh! what did she say?</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> It broke her heart.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> None. That is none&mdash;that&mdash;that I can name.</p>

<p><i>Eily</i> There is one&mdash;I see it.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> There is. We were children when we were married, and I
could get no priest to join our hands but one, and he had been disgraced
by his bishop. He is dead. There was no witness to the ceremony
but Danny Mann&mdash;no proof but his word, and your certificate.</p>

<p><i>Eily</i> [<i>Takes paper from her breast.</i>] This!</p>

gives you the right to the shelter of my roof; but oh! if you would
be content with the shelter of my heart.</p>

<p><i>Eily</i> And will it save ye, Hardress? And will your mother forgive
me?</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> You were up late, I think?</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> I was. I watched by my window for hours, thinking of her
I loved&mdash;slumber overtook me, and I dreamed of a happiness I never
can hope for.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Look me straight in the face.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Oh! if some fairy could strike us into stone now&mdash;and leave
us looking forever into each other’s faces, like the blue lake below
and the sky above it!</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Kyrle Daly! What would you say to a man who had two
loves, one to whom he escaped at night, and the other to whom he
devoted himself during the day&mdash;what would you say?</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> I’d say he had no chance.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Oh, Captain Cautious! Well answered. Isn’t he fit to take
care of anybody! his cradle was cut out of a witness-box.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span>] Anne! I don’t know what you mean, but that I know
that I love you, and you are sporting with a wretchedness you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
not console. I was wrong to remain here so long, but I thought my
friendship for Hardress would protect me against your invasion&mdash;now
I will go.    <span class="dirr">[<span class="smcap">Hardress</span> <i>advancing</i>.</span></p>

<p><i>Hard</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">C.</span>] No, Kyrle, you will stay. Anne, he loves you, and I
more than suspect you prefer him to me. From this moment you
are free; I release you from all troth to me: in his presence I do this.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> [<span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span>] Hardress!</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> There is a bar between us which you should have known before,
but I could not bring myself to confess. Forgive me, Anne&mdash;you
deserve a better man than I am.    <span class="dirr">[<i>Exit</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></span></p>

<p><i>Anne</i> A bar between us! What does he mean?</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> He means that he is on the verge of ruin: he did not know
how bad things were till last night. His generous noble heart recoils
from receiving anything from you but love.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> And does he think I’d let him be ruined any way? Does he
think I wouldn’t sell the last rood of land&mdash;the gown off my back,
and the hair off my head, before that boy that protected and loved
me, the child, years ago, should come to a hap’orth of harrum?</p>

<div class="dirownr">[<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span></div>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Miss Chute!</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Well, I can’t help it. When I am angry the brogue comes
out, and my Irish heart will burst through manners, and graces, and
twenty stay-laces. [<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span>] I’ll give up my fortune&mdash;that I
will!</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> You can’t&mdash;you’ve got a guardian who can not consent to
such a sacrifice.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Have I? then I’ll find a husband that will.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] She means me&mdash;I see it in her eyes.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] He’s trying to look unconscious. [<i>Aloud.</i>] Kyrle
Daly, on your honor and word as a gentleman, do you love me and
nobody else?</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Do you think me capable of contaminating your image by
admitting a meaner passion into my breast?</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Yes, I do.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Then you wrong me.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> I’ll prove that in one word. Take care, now; it’s coming.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Go on.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Now I’ll astonish him. [<i>Aloud.</i>] Eily!</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> What’s that?</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> “Shule, shule, agrah!”</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Where to?</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Three winks, as much as to say, “Are you coming?” and an
extinguisher above here means “Yes.” Now you see I know all
about it.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> You have the advantage of me.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Confess now, and I’ll forgive you.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> I will; tell me what to confess, and I’ll confess it&mdash;I don’t
care what it is.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] If I hadn’t eye proof he’d brazen it out of me. Isn’t
he cunning? He’s one of those that would get fat where a fox would
starve.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> That was a little excursion into my past life&mdash;a sudden descent
on my antecedents, to see if you could not surprise an infidelity&mdash;but
I defy you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Anne</i> You do? I accept that defiance; and, mind me, Kyrle, if I
find you true as I once thought, there’s my hand; but if you are
false in this, Anne Chute will never change her name for yours. [<i>He
kisses her hand.</i>] Leave me now.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Oh, the lightness you have given to my heart! The number
of pipes I’ll smoke this afternoon will make them think we’ve got a
haystack on fire.    <span class="dirr">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Kyrle</span>, <i>through window</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span></span></p>

rather see you in your coffin than married to this poor, lowborn, silly,
vulgar creature. I know you, my son; you will be miserable when
the infatuation of first love is past; when you turn from her and face
the world, as one day you must do, you will blush to say, “This is
my wife.” Every word from her mouth will be a pang to your pride.
You will follow her movements with terror&mdash;the contempt and derision
she excites will rouse you first to remorse, and then to hatred&mdash;and

a curse.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> I want you to see Hardress. For ten days past he shuns the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
society of his bride. By night he creeps out alone in his boat on the
lake&mdash;by day he wanders round the neighborhood, pale as death. He
is heart-broken.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Has ye asked to see me?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> Yesterday he asked where you were.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Did he forget that I left your house when Miss Chute, without
a word of explanation, behaved so unkindly to me?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C</i> She is not the same girl since she accepted Hardress. She
quarrels&mdash;weeps&mdash;complains, and has lost her spirits.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> She feels the neglect of Hardress.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> [<i>Without</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span>] Don’t answer me! Obey, and hold your tongue!</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> [<i>Sharply.</i>] I don’t flatter myself you wished to see me; why

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Anne, I am sorry I offended you; I don’t know what I did,

<p><i>Anne</i> Not the slightest.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> I released your neighborhood of my presence.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Yes, and you released the neighborhood of the presence of
somebody else&mdash;she and you disappeared together.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> She!</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Never mind.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> But I do mind. I love Hardress Cregan as a brother, and I
hope the time may come, Anne, when I can love you as a sister.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Do you? I don’t.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> I don’t want the dislike of my friend’s wife to part my friend
and me.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Why should it? I’m nobody.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> If you were my wife, and asked me to hate any one, I’d do
it&mdash;I couldn’t help it.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> I believed words like that once when you spoke them, but I
have been taught how basely you can deceive.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Who taught you?</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Who?&mdash;your wife.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> My what?</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Your wife&mdash;the girl you concealed in the cottage on Muckross
Head. Stop, now&mdash;don’t speak&mdash;save a falsehood, however
many ye may have to spare. I saw the girl&mdash;she confessed.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Confessed that she was my wife?</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Bring her before me and let her speak.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> How do I know where she is?</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> Well, bring your boatman then, who told me the same.</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> I tell you it is false; I never saw&mdash;never knew the girl.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> You look distressed, Kyrle. Anne, what is the matter?</p>

<p><i>Kyrle</i> Nothing, Hardress. I was about to ask Miss Chute to forget
a subject which was painful to her, and to beg of her never to
mention it again&mdash;not even to you, Hardress.</p>

<p><i>Hard</i> I am sure she will deny you nothing.</p>

ever loved. When he’s here near by me, I could give him the
worst treatment a man could desire, and when he goes away he
takes the heart and all of me off with him, and I feel like
an unfurnished house. This is pretty feelings for a girl to have, and
she in her regimentals. Oh! if he wasn’t married&mdash;but he is, and
he’d have married me as well&mdash;the malignant! Oh! if he had, how
I’d have made him swing for it&mdash;it would have afforded me the happiest

I was a-tellin’ you&mdash;Dan Dayley was there&mdash;he had just kim’d in.
“Good morrow,&mdash;good day”&mdash;ses he. “Good morrow, good Dan,
ses I,”&mdash;jest that ways entirely&mdash;“it’s an opening to the heart to
see you.” Well, yer riverence, as I ware sayin’,&mdash;“long life an’
good wife to ye, Masther Dan,” ses I. “Thank ye, ses he, and the
likes to ye, anyway.” The moment I speck them words, Dan got
heart, an’ up an’ tould Murty about his love for Murty’s darter&mdash;the
Colleen Rue. The moment he heard that, he puts elbows in himself,
an’ stood lookin’ at him out on the flure. “You flog Europe, for
boldness,” ses he&mdash;“get out of my sight,” ses he,&mdash;“this moment,”
ses he,&mdash;“or I’ll give yer a kick that will rise you from poverty to
the highest pitch of affluence,” ses he&mdash;“away out ’o that, you notorious
delinquent; single your freedom, and double your distance,”
ses he. Well, Dan was forced to cut an’ run. Poor boy! I was sorry

<p>Who would not be Beautiful? Those who are beautiful by nature, can make
themselves more bewitching with</p>


<p class="center large">Hagan’s Magnolia Balm.</p>

<p>Those who are not thus gifted can add greatly to their attractions by its use.</p>

<p><b>Madame de Stael</b> said she would gladly give up the power conferred by
her intellectual position, if she could thereby purchase beauty. Throughout
all time <span class="smcap">Man</span> has done homage to Beauty, and bestowed upon <i>Beautiful Woman</i>
his life’s devotion and adoration.</p>

<p>Nature has not been so lavish of her gifts in this direction, as some of the
fair Daughters of Eve may desire. Many lack the first great essential of loveliness,
<b>a Fresh and Blooming Complexion</b>.</p>

<p>Without it, all other beauties are marred; with it, the plainest features soften
into refinement and glow with loveliness. <i>Hagan’s Magnolia Balm</i> produces this
effect and gives to the Complexion the</p>


<p class="center">FRESHNESS OF YOUTH.</p>

<p>If you wish to get rid of <b>Redness</b>, <b>Blotches</b>, <b>Pimples</b>, <b>etc.</b>, you should
use this delightful article.</p>

<p>It is what Actresses, Opera Singers and Ladies of fashions use to create that
<i>distingue</i> appearance so much admired by every one.</p>

<p>By its use the roughest skin is made to rival the pure radiant texture of
<b>Youthful Beauty</b>.</p>

<p>Hagan’s Magnolia Balm overcomes the flushed appearance caused by <b>heat,
fatigue and excitement</b>, makes the eye look clear, full and bright, and
imparts a genial, lively expression to the countenance, indicating intellectual
power and natural grace.</p>

<p>Ladies exposed to the summer sun, or spring winds, causing <b>Tan, Sunburn
and Freckles</b>, will find this Balm of great value, as it removes these defects
by a few applications. In fact this article is the great <b>Secret of Beauty</b>; no
Lady who values a <b>Youthful</b> appearance can do without it.</p>

<p>It makes a <b>Lady of Thirty appear but Twenty</b>; and so natural,
gradual and perfect are its effects, that no person can detect its application.</p>

<p>The Magnolia Balm transforms the Rustic Country Girl into a City Belle, more
rapidly than any other one thing.</p>

<p>Applied to the <b>Neck, Arms and Hands</b>, it imparts an appearance of
<b>graceful rotundity and engaging plumpness</b>, as well as a <b>pearly
blooming purity</b>, which is ever the admiration of the opposite sex. When
used upon the person it exhales a subdued fragrance, suggesting pure habits
and a cultivated taste.</p>

<p>The Magnolia Balm contains nothing in the least injurious to the skin.</p>

<p>The patronage awarded the Magnolia Balm by fashionable ladies of New York,
Opera Singers and Actresses, and its rapidly growing demand, induces us to
recommend it with unbounded confidence. It costs but <b>75 Cents per bottle</b>,
and is sold by all Druggists, Perfumers and General Stores. Originally prepared
by <span class="smcap">Wm. E. Hagan, Troy, N. Y.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For Preserving and Beautifying the Human Hair. To Prevent
its Falling Out and Turning Gray.</p></div>

<p>A well preserved Head of Hair, in a person of middle age, at once bespeaks refinement,
elegance, health and beauty. It may truly be called Woman’s Crowning
Glory, while men are not insensible to its advantages and charms. Few
things are more disgusting than thin, frizzly, harsh, untamed Hair, with head
and coat covered with Dandruff. Visit a barber and you feel and look like a
new man. This is what <b>LYON’S KATHAIRON</b> will do all the time.
The charm which lies in well placed Hair, Glossy Curls, Luxuriant Tresses,
and a Clean Head, is noticeable and irresistible.</p>

<p>The Ladies, (who are the best judges of what pertains to beauty and adornment,)
are getting to understand the value and importance of a fine Head of Hair.
Thus, we see that more and more attention is paid to the Culture, Growth and
Preservation of the Hair by both sexes. Women are not alone in the desire
to improve their Tresses.</p>

<p>Barber shops and hair dressing saloons multiply in number, and Ladies’ hair
dressing is fast becoming a fine art.</p>

<p>And thus the demand for LYON’S KATHAIRON constantly increases, and
every day adds new testimony to its very great value.</p>

<p>Do you ask why? For the following reasons: (More could be given, but these
ought to be satisfactory to start with.)</p>


<ul><li><b>Because it increases the Growth and Beauty of the Hair.</b></li>
<li><b>Because it is a Delightful Dressing.</b></li>
<li><b>Because it Eradicates Dandruff.</b></li>
<li><b>Because it Prevents the Hair from Falling Out.</b></li>
<li><b>Because it Prevents the Hair from Turning Gray.</b></li>
<li><b>Because it Keeps the Head Cool and heals Pimples.</b></li>
<li><b>Because it gives the Hair a rich, soft, glossy appearance.</b></li>
</ul>


<p>The now widely celebrated Kathairon, was first discovered and introduced to
the public in 1848, by Prof. E. Thomas Lyon, a graduate of Princeton College,
N. J. The name is derived from the Greek, “<i>Kathro</i>,” or “<i>Kathairo</i>,” signifying
to cleanse, purify, rejuvenate, or restore. The favor it has received and the
popularity it has obtained, is unprecedented and incredible. It was found to be
not only a beautiful Dressing for the Hair, but to act medicinally upon the head
in cleansing it of Scurf and Dandruff, and restoring Hair upon Bald Heads.</p>

<p><i>Baldness</i> is an American peculiarity so often witnessed, that many candidly
suppose it <i>constitutional, hereditary, or a natural exhaustion of the powers of
nature</i>. It is frequently caused by wearing a too thick covering upon the Head;
by straining the Hair too hard in parting, and by neglecting to clean the Scalp
from Dandruff and other impurities. A free use of Kathairon will entirely
obviate this difficulty, as its cleansing and purifying properties immediately
remove all these impurities. We are confident in saying that <i>in every case</i> (except
where the Hair is entirely dead, <i>which very seldom exists</i>,) a continued application
of the <span class="smcap">Kathairon</span> <i>will restore the Hair to its former Strength and Vigor</i>.</p>


<p>To Prevent the Hair from coming out, USE LYON’S KATHAIRON.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is a most delightful Hair Dressing.</li>
<li>It eradicates scurf and dandruff.</li>
<li>It keeps the head cool and clean.</li>
<li>It makes the hair rich, soft and glossy.</li>
<li>It prevents hair from turning gray and falling off.</li>
<li>It restores hair upon premature bald heads.</li>
</ul>


<p>The above is just what Lyon’s Kathairon will do. It is pretty&mdash;it is cheap&mdash;durable.
It is literally sold by the car-load, and yet the almost incredible demand
is daily increasing, until there is hardly a country store that does not keep it, or a
family that does not use it. All Druggists sell it. Price, in large bottles, 50 cents.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
